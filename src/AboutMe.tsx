      <h2 className="mb-2">About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a full-stack software engineer with a passion for design and
        accessibility. I create elegant solutions to problems others ignore.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-lg my-2">Experience summary</h3>
      <p>
        I have worked on a very diverse set of projects with different languages
        and frameworks, but my primary toolset is{" "}
        <b>.NET, TypeScript and React</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have a good knowledge of <b>SQL Server</b>. I have written
        queries, sprocs and triggers. I know how to organise a schema and set
        indices. I know how to migrate data during schema changes and how to
        back it up.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-lg my-2">Skills</h3>
      <p>
        I am one of the <b>fastest learners</b> I know. I can quickly and
        intuitively grasp technical concepts and apply them almost immediately.
        With a little more experience I can teach it too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy <b>teaching</b>. Shortly after learning something I'll spread
        that knowledge in the form of one-to-one teaching, documentation,
        debates or a talk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike many developers, I am <b>passionate about design</b>. I will
        regularly give suggestions to designers, and I am more often trusted by
        them to make design decisions than my peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about <b>accessibility</b>, and I make a conscious
        effort to make my creations a good experience for people who have
        disabilities.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-lg my-2">Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        I spend my spare time coding, playing video games and building up my
        collection of movies and series.
      </p>
      <p>I also often teach software development one-to-one.</p>
