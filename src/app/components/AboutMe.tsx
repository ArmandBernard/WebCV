      <h2 className="mb-2">About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a full-stack software engineer with a passion for design and
        accessibility. I create elegant solutions to problems others ignore.
      </p>
      <h3 className="my-2">Experience summary</h3>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve worked on software for over 5 years, primarily with{" "}
        <b>.NET, TypeScript and React</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a good knowledge of <b>SQL Server</b> thanks to my time working
        on database management tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience planning and running initiatives, small teams /
        projects and doing technical talks.
      </p>
      <h3 className="my-2">Skills</h3>
      <p>
        I am a <b>fast learner</b>. I can quickly and intuitively grasp
        technical concepts and apply them almost immediately. With a little more
        experience I can teach it too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy <b>teaching</b>. Shortly after learning something I&apos;ll
        spread that knowledge in the form of one-to-one teaching, documentation,
        debates or a technical talk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike many developers, I am passionate about <b>design</b>. I will
        regularly advise designers on accessibility, design system standards and
        engineering feasibility. I am often trusted to make design decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about <b>accessibility</b>, and I make a conscious
        effort to make my creations a good experience for people with
        disabilities.
      </p>
      <h3 className="my-2">Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        I spend my spare time coding, playing video games and building up my
        collection of movies and series.
