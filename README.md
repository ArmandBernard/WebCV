This is the repository is where I manage my Web CV!

[Go to the live site](https://armandbernard.github.io/WebCV/)

The site will use a light or dark theme, based on your system theme.

GitHub Actions are used to build and deploy the site automatically every time a change is pushed to the main branch.
